# This project depend from mapnik 2, spatialite, bottle and beautifulsoup (optionnally, matplotlib)
# Beautifulsoup is only used to retrieve wikipedia content for demo purpose
# The demo was tested with python 2.6 on Linux 10.04

# Do

python raphaelpython.py to retrieve data, generate map, parse to svg raphael can consume.

# Launch the webserver
python web_server.py

# Open your browser

firefox http://localhost:8000/france.html

The interactivity isn't well configurated at the moment.

The main advantage of the way we generate svg is the fact, we rely on Mapnik
rendering engine to put labels and we're able to take any input ogr/gdal accept.
